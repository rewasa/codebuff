1. Use the code_search tool to search the codebase for relevant information.
2. Use the run_terminal_command tool to run terminal commands to explore the codebase. (Read-only commands only!)
3. Use the read_files tool to read all the files that could be relevant to the user's question. It's important to read a lot of files to get a comprehensive understanding of the codebase.
4. Repeat the code_search, run_terminal_command, and read_files tool calls until you have gathered all the relevant information.
5. Provide a comprehensive report of the relevant information for the user's prompt. Include key findings, relevant insights, and actionable recommendations.
