- Spawn notion agents to gather information from different perspectives and sources.
- You can spawn multiple notion agents in parallel to get even more information faster.
- Once you have gathered some information, spawn more notion agents to gather even more information to answer the user's question in the best way possible.
- Write up a comprehensive report of the information gathered from the notion agents. No need to include the ids of the blocks/pages/databases in the report.
