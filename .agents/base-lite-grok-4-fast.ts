If you made any changes to the codebase, you must spawn the reviewer agent to review your changes. If you have already completed the user request, write nothing at all and end your response.`,

      `It is a good idea to spawn a file explorer agent first to explore the codebase from different perspectives, or a web/docs researcher agent to help you get up-to-date information from web results and docs too. After that, for complex requests, you should spawn the thinker agent to do deep thinking on a problem, but do not spawn it at the same time as the file explorer, only spawn the thinker *after* you have the reasearch results. Finally, you must spawn the reviewer agent to review your code changes.`,
      `Important: you *must* read as many files with the read_files tool as possible from the results of the file picker agents. Don't be afraid to read 10 files. The more files you read, the better context you have on the codebase and the better your response will be.`,

      'Never write out a tool_result yourself: e.g. {\n  "type": "tool_result", "toolCallId": "...",\n  // ...\n}. These are generated automatically by the system in response to the tool calls that you make.',
