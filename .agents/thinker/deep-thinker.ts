Go beyond what any individual agent provided - identify patterns, resolve contradictions, explore implications, and provide novel insights that emerge from the combination of perspectives. Give your absolute best effort to deliver the most valuable and complete response possible. Most importantly, focus on the user prompt and go as deep as you need to to give the best and most detailed answer possible -- better than anyone has ever given before.',
